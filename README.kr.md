# PROJECT OVERVIEW
# Manufacturer-Independent Drone Platform
---

### [KOREAN GUIDE](https://github.com/seyun4047/drone-platform-docs/blob/main/components/platform/overview.kr.md)

---

It is a **manufacturer-independent integrated drone monitoring platform!**

It is designed to manage various drones within a single environment,
enabling both **high-end professional drones and commercially available hobby camera drones**
to be used for lifesaving and disaster response.

---

## Project Structure

This platform consists of multiple independent repositories:

| Component | Description                                       | Repository                                                              |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Server | Core drone platform server (API, Auth, Telemetry) | [GitHub](https://github.com/seyun4047/drone-platform-server)            |

## Background

Although custom drones, commercial drones, and consumer drones share similar basic control mechanisms,
their operational methods and **command-and-control structures** in real-world environments vary significantly.

In practice, drones are often utilized as tools that depend heavily on:
- Specific equipment
- Highly trained personnel

Recently, many institutions and companies have attempted to build drone systems integrated with AI technologies.  
However, these systems have clear limitations. They typically rely on tuning specific drone models or operating a single type of custom-built drone, which results in strong dependency on specialized personnel and proprietary technologies.

Such dependency is particularly critical in **life-saving and disaster response operations**.

---
## Project Goal
- A manufacturer-independent drone monitoring platform that supports lifesaving and disaster response operations.

---
## Objectives

- A drone monitoring and management system deployable regardless of drone model or manufacturer
- A system that can be immediately deployed in the field without complex control procedures
- A system that does not rely on the performance capabilities of specific drone hardware
- A system that allows non-professional drone hobbyists to contribute effectively in emergency situations

---

## Expected Impact

In life-saving and disaster response scenarios, before professional equipment or rescue teams arrive on site,  
any available drone—if operable by anyone—can be immediately deployed to:
- Assess victims
- Identify hazards
- Estimate damage

By securing this critical **golden time**, the system enables faster decision-making and more effective deployment of advanced rescue resources, ultimately leading to more sophisticated and impactful drone-assisted emergency response systems.
